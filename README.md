# pomodoro-timer

Created with the help of bolt.new.
After 60 minutes I got 90% of it working.

Adding audio, favicon, and correctly working logic and interaction took 4 hours.
I got a lot of help from chatGPT, claude and deepseek.
But now it is to my liking and everything should work as expected.

give it a try!
